# Sour Dough Bread 

## Feeding the starter

Discard all but a small amount.  I've been feedding once a day at night.  That way the starter is active and ready to use in the morning.

* 75 grams bread flour 
* 25 grams rye flour 
* 100 grams water (distilled)

If you are hybernating the starter in the fridge, take the starter out and feed for about 3 days to bring it back to active state. 

If you're going to bake bread on Saturday morning, take starter out of fridge and start feeding on Tuesday.

## Making the dough 

For a Saturday bake, I've been making dough on Friday morning.

* 350 grams luke warm water
* 450 grams of bread flour 
* 50 grams of wheat flour 
* 10 grams salt
* 100 grams active starter
