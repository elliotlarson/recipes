# Pancakes

## Easy Recipe

### Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups flour
* 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/2 tablespoon sugar
* 1 1/2 cup milk (or buttermilk)
* 1 egg
* 3 tablespoons melted butter

### Instructions

Mix all ingredients together in mixing bowl to form batter.  Melt butter in pan over medium heat and then ladle portions of the mix onto the pan.  I usually make the pancakes on the small side.

It's also pretty yummy to add some semi-sweet chocolate chips or banana chunks or strawberry chunks or blueberry chunks to the top of the pancake after adding them to the pan (about 5 or 6 for a small pancake).  I also like to sprinkle some large finishing salt flakes on top of the pancake after adding the chocolate chips.

If you have buttermilk handy you can swap out the milk for buttermilk.  This gives it some extra flavor.  If you don't have buttermilk on hand, you can add in a touch of white vinegar to add a similar amount of acid in the buttermilk (tip from Marilyn Nergord), however I haven't tried this yet.  Need to figure out how much a "touch" is.

## Sour Dough Pancakes

These are yummy, but you need to have some sour dough starter handy.
