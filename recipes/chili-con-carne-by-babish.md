## Ingredients

* 2 pasilla chiles (dried whole)
* 4 arbol chiles (dried whole)
* 4 chipotle chiles (dried whole)
* 3 guajillo chiles (dried whole)
* 3 ancho chiles (dried whole)
* 1 whole chuck roast
* Vegetable oil
* 1 white onion, roughly chopped
* 6 cloves garlic, crushed
* 4 cups chicken stock
* Cinnamon
* Ground allspice
* Ground coriander
* Dried oregano
* 2-3 Tbsp tomato paste
* 2-3 Tbsp masa harina
* 2 limes, juiced
* Shredded cheese, for garnish

## Directions

1. Remove the stems and seeds from all dried chiles. Tear each chile into small pieces.

2. Dry roast the chiles by placing them in a large stainless steel skillet with no oil. Toast over medium-high heat for 3-5 minutes, until they are fragrant but not smoking. 

3. Lower the heat and rehydrate the chiles by adding water – just enough water to cover them. 

4. Bring to a simmer and cover. Then turn off the heat and let steep for 10 minutes.

5. Add the chiles and their soaking liquid to a high-powered blender. Blend on high speed for about one minute, until nice and smooth. This makes your amazing chili paste base.

6. Break down your chuck roast by trimming off any silver skin or excess fat. Cut into ½-inch bite-sized cubes.

7. Pat the pieces of meat dry with Bounty paper towels. Generously salt the meat with kosher salt. Let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes before blotting dry again with Bounty paper towels.

8. Heat a few tablespoons of vegetable oil in a dutch oven over medium-high heat, until it just starts to give off wisps of smoke.  

9. Add half of the cubed meat to the dutch oven, turning to brown on all sides. Once browned, remove from pan and set aside. You do not need to brown the rest of the meat.

10. Add chopped onion to the pot. Cook over medium heat until soft and golden. Add 6 cloves of crushed garlic. Sauté with the onions until fragrant, about one minute.  

11. Deglaze the pot with 4 cups of chicken stock. Scrape up the fond from the bottom of the pot to make sure everything is incorporated.

12. Add all meat to the pot, followed by 1 ½ cups of homemade chili paste.  

13. Bring the pot to a simmer. Add cinnamon, allspice, ground coriander, and oregano to taste. Add a few tablespoons of tomato paste (optional).  

14. Partially cover the pot and simmer until the beef is tender and the soup has thickened, anywhere from 1 ½-3 hours.

15. Once the beef is tender, add 2-3 tablespoons of masa harina to thicken the chili. Also add the juice of 2 limes. Stir and let cook for 5 more minutes.

16. Serve with shredded cheese and lime wedges, or any garnishes you like!
