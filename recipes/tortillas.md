# Mix Corn and Flour Tortilla 

## Ingredients

* 1 cup unbleached flour (perhaps a tbsp or so more)
* 1 cup masa harina
* 1/4 cup lard (shortening or unsalted butter, 1/2 stick)
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup warm water

## Directions 

Place 1 cup flour, masa harina, lard, shortening or butter, baking powder and salt in a bowl of a food processor fitted with the dough blade. Pulse a few times to combine the ingredients.

Pour about 3/4 of a cup of warm water down the chute with the motor running.

Add either a bit more water or flour until you have a soft dough ball which leaves the sides of the bowl cleanly. Run another minute or so, or remove the dough and knead it a bit. Cover and allow to rest for about 30 minutes.

Divide the dough into 8 to 12 balls. Either roll each one out or flatten them in a tortilla press between 2 pieces of parchment paper.

Cook the tortillas, one at a time in a hot ungreased skillet, about 1-2  minutes on each side. Adjust the temperature if necessary to keep them from burning.
