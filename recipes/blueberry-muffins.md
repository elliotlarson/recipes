# Blueberry Muffins Recipe

## Ingredients

* ½ cup softened butter
* 1 ¼ cups sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 cups flour
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* ½ cup milk
* 2 cups blueberries, washed, drained and picked over
* 3 teaspoons sugar

## Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 375.
1. Cream the butter and 1 1/4 cups sugar until light.
1. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add vanilla.
1. Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder, and add to the creamed mixture alternately with the milk.
1. Crush 1/2 cup blueberries with a fork, and mix into the batter. Fold in the remaining whole berries.
1. Line a 12 cup standard muffin tin with cupcake liners, and fill with batter. Sprinkle the 3 teaspoons sugar over the tops of the muffins, and bake at 375 degrees for about 30-35 minutes.
1. Remove muffins from tin and cool at least 30 minutes. Store, uncovered, or the muffins will be too moist the second day, if they last that long.
