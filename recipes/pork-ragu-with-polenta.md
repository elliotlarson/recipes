# Pork Ragu

## Ingredients

* 2 lb pork shoulder or rump, cut into squares
* 1 lb pork bones or boney pieces of pork
* 1 cup full flavored red wine
* 2 cups chicken stock
* 28 oz can of San Marzano crushed tomatoes
* 2 tblsp Olive oil
* 1 large onion chopped into small pieces
* 5 clove garlic finely chopped
* 1/4 cup coarsley chopped parsley
* 1 tblsp chopped thyme
* 1 or 2 bay leaves
* 1/2 tblsp finely chop rosemary
* salt/pepper to taste

## Preparation

1. Heat oil in pot on medium high heat.  I recommend an enameled cast iron pot, like a Le Creuset.  Brown sides of port chunks.
1. Remove browned pork and place on side.
1. Add chopped onions to pot with rendered pork fat and oil. Add some salt to onions.  Cook for about 5-7 minutes, until onions are translucent and starting to brown.
1. Add garlic to onions and cook for about 1 minute.
1. Add cup of red wine and deglaze bottom of pan.  Cook for about 4-5 minutes.
1. Add crushed tomatoes, thyme, rosemary, bay leaves, some salt/pepper (3 or 4 pinches and a couple of ginds), and chicken stock to pot and bring to a boil.
1. Add pork back in and reduce heat to simmer.  Cook pork for about 2-3 hours until pieces are tender and almost fallimg apart, stiring every 30-45 minutes.  If the base starts to get a little too thick, add more chicken stock
1. At the end, add salt and pepper to taste and remove bay leaves.  Mix in chopped parsley just before serving.
