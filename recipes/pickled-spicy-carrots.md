# Tartine's Spicy Pickled Carrots

The sandwiches at Tartine are out of this world, but the carrots that come with it really balance the dish.  I've been there six or seven times over the years and I always ask for more carrots.  2 just isn't enough.  They've never been willing to give me more... punks.  Thankfully the recipe has made its way online.
