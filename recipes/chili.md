## Instructions

Add olive oil to dutch oven, heat pan and oil up.  Add onions and shallots and cook for 5-6 minutes.  Add garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes.  Add ground beef and cook and chop of beef into tiny pieces (I use two spatulas to break apart beef chunks and finish by mashing small beef chunks with a whisk).  Strain tomato juice from can of tomatoes into pot.  Chop remaining tomato chunks into smaller pieces and add to pot.  Add in cumin, paprika, and chili powder.  Add in chicken stock, heat up and then add in honey.  Simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

In another pan, add water, apple cider vinegar.  Cut dried peppers in half and add.  Simmer for 20 minutes to rehydrate.  Take out rehydrated peppers, remove any stem and pepper butt parts.  Mince peppers into an almost pepper paste.  Add pepper paste to main chili pot.   Whisk masa flour into remaining water and vinegar mixture to make a sort of roux.  Add to main chili pot.

Simmer chili for another 30 minutes.  Then add in chocolate.  Stir until melted.  Add in salt and pepper to taste.
