# Cinnamon Chocolate Bundt Cake

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup button
* 1 cup water
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 5 tablespoons cocoa power (I like to use King Arthur Flour's Black Cocoa)
* 2 cups flour
* 2 cups sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon
* 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

## Instructions

Preheat the over to 375.  Grease a large bundt pan with cooking spray. Put buttoner, water, oil, and cocoa in a medium sauce pan and bring to a boil.

Meanwhile, whisk together flour, sugar, salt in a mixing bowl.  Pour the chocolate mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix well.  Then, add the buttermilk and baking soda.

Mix together the eggs, cinnamon, and vanilla in a small bowl, and add to the batter.  Pour batter into prepared bundt pan.

Bake 45-50 minutes.  Allow cake to cool in the pan before turning over to remove cake.
