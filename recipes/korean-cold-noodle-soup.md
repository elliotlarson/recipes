# Mild Cold Noodle Soup (Mul-naengmyeon)

**Serves 2**

This ice-cold noodle soup is so refreshing that I. could eat it every day in the summertime. Try it, and you will feel your body temperature cool right down. It is a little tangy from the fermented radish broth, a little sweet from the pear, and rich and meaty from the brisket. I like it best when the broth is almost frozen but still slushy. You’ve probably never had anything like it, and once you taste it, you will be hooked.

Most Koreans buy the noodles (available in Korean grocery stores) for this soup rather than preparing them from scratch. Made with wheat flour and a little bit of buckwheat, they are quite chewy—a bit like thin red licorice laces in texture.

The broth, a combination of beef brisket broth and the brine from Radish-Water Kimchi, will make your tongue tingle. Note that you need to prepare the broth 7 or 8 hours ahead so you have time to freeze it.

Shortcut: If you’re too busy to make the brisket and kimchi broth, use the packet of powdered or liquid concentrated broth included in the package of naengmyeon noodles. Follow the instructions on the package to make the broth. Freeze until slushy before using.

## Ingredients

* 8 ounces beef brisket
* 7 cups water
* 4 cups brine from Radish-Water Kimchi
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* ¼ cup plus 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 medium Asian pear, or 2 Bosc pears
* 10 ounces naengmyeon noodles
* 10 slices Radish-Water Kimchi, plus more for serving
* ¼ English cucumber, cut into matchsticks
* 1 large hard-boiled egg, shelled and cut in half
* 1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds
* 2 teaspoons Korean mustard seed powder (gyeoja-garu; optional)

## Directions

1. Rinse the brisket under cold running water, then soak in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes to remove any blood (this will give you a nice, clear broth).
1. Bring the 7 cups water to a boil in a small pot over high heat. Drain the brisket and add to the pot. Turn the heat down to medium and cook, covered, for 1 hour. Turn the heat down to low and cook for another 50 minutes.
1. Remove the brisket from the pot and set the broth aside to cool. Let the beef cool, then thinly slice it. Cover and refrigerate.
1. Combine the beef broth and kimchi brine in a metal bowl. Add the salt and ¼ cup of the sugar and stir to dissolve. Cover and freeze until the mixture is slushy but not completely frozen, 5 to 6 hours.
1. Mix 2 cups water with the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar in a bowl. Shortly before serving, peel, core, and thinly slice the pear. Add the pear to the sugar water and let sit for a minute (this will keep it from turning brown). Drain.
1. When you are ready to serve, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles, stirring with a wooden spoon so they won’t stick together, and boil until tender but still chewy, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the noodles in a colander and rinse under cold running water until cooled and no longer slippery.
1. Divide the noodles between two shallow individual serving bowls. Divide the partly frozen broth between the bowls. Arrange the beef, radish kimchi, cucumber, pear, and egg halves on top. Sprinkle with the toasted sesame seeds. If you’d like to make the soup spicy, mix the mustard seed powder with 1 teaspoon water and spoon a little bit into each bowl. Serve immediately, with more radishes on the side.

# Spicy Cold Noodle Soup (Mul-naengmyeon)

There are two types of Korean cold noodles. These chewy noodles in a red sauce are sweet, sour, spicy, and intense, while Cold Noodle Soup is mild, tangy, and brothy. I can never decide which one I like better!

In a restaurant, after the dish is presented to you, your server will come with a pair of scissors and ask if you want your long noodles cut in half. If you do, he will snip them right in the bowl. You can do the same at home if you prefer shorter noodles.

## Ingredients for the spicy sauce

* ½ Asian pear, or 1 Bosc pear, peeled, cored, and chopped
* 2 tablespoons minced onion
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1 teaspoon minced peeled ginger
* ¼ cup Korean hot pepper flakes (gochu-garu)
* 2 tablespoons Korean hot pepper paste (gochujang)
* 2 scallions, chopped
* 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* ¼ cup brown rice syrup (ssal-yeot) or honey
* 2 teaspoons sugar
* 2 tablespoons distilled white or apple cider vinegar
* 2 tablespoons beef stock or water

## Ingredients for the noodles

* 10 ounces naengmyeon noodles
* ½ Asian pear, or 1 small Bosc pear, peeled and cored
* 1 cup brine from Radish-Water Kimchi, frozen until slushy
* 8 to 12 slices Radish-Water Kimchi, or
* ⅓ cup chopped Napa Cabbage Kimchi
* ½ English cucumber, cut into ½-inch-thick matchsticks (about ½ cup)
* 1 large hard-boiled egg, shelled and halved
* 1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds ​ Distilled white or apple cider vinegar, for serving (optional)

## Directions

1. Make the spicy seasoning sauce: Put the pear in a food processor and process until smooth.
1. Measure out ½ cup of the pear puree and transfer to a bowl. (Discard the rest of the puree.) Add the onion, garlic, ginger, hot pepper flakes, hot pepper paste, scallions, toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, salt, rice syrup, sugar, vinegar, and beef broth. Combine all the ingredients in the food processor and process until creamy. Cover and refrigerate for up to 1 week.
1. Make the noodles: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles, stirring with a wooden spoon so they won’t stick together, and boil until tender but still chewy, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain the noodles in a colander and rinse under cold running water until cooled and no longer slippery. Divide the noodles between two shallow serving bowls.
1. Peel, core, and thinly slice the pear.
1. Spoon seasoning sauce to taste over each portion of noodles. Add ½ cup icy-cold brine to each bowl. Arrange the kimchi, cucumber, pear, and egg halves on top. Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds over the eggs. Serve immediately, with the remaining seasoning sauce and, if desired, extra vinegar on the side.
